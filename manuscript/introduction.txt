# Introduction

The motivation for writing came from the hope that it can help benefit the maritime industry by planting the seeds for the readers in how to tackle such a complex but interesting topic as cybersecurity.  Even if the book just has one maritime company or individual improve their environment and reduce risks then i have achieved my objective. 

If you switch to writing in the Markua syntax instead of Leanpub-Flavored Markdown, please be sure to rename the `images` folder in your `manuscript` folder to `resources.`

If you have any feedback on the book, please email me at <book@cybersecurityinthehighseas.com>.
